## This is where your Laravel app goes

To get started, **delete this file** and then do one of the following:

- Clone your project or copy all of the files directly into this `src` directory.
- Spin up the Docker network by following the instructions on the main [README.md](../README.md), and install a brand new Laravel project by running `docker compose run --rm composer create-project --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced .` in your terminal.
